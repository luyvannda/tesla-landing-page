# ! Tesla Landing Page is a project built with

# React + Tailwind + TypeScript + Vite

This is a tailwind projects that I learned to built from 2023's Tailwind Beginner to Advanced with Projects course from Udemy taught by Code Bless You.

The project taught in Udemy only covered the tailwind classes built with vanilla html, where as this project was built with extra codes using React.js, TypeScript. It also more responsive and have extra features like a drop down menu from Tailwinds UI.
